## Description

BNBChain MCP is a Model Context Protocol implementation that enables seamless interaction with blockchain networks through AI-powered interfaces. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and resources for blockchain development, smart contract interaction, and network management.

## Core Modules

The project is organized into several core modules:

- **Blocks**: Query and manage blockchain blocks
- **Contracts**: Interact with smart contracts
- **Network**: Network information and management
- **NFT**: NFT (ERC721/ERC1155) operations
- **Tokens**: Token (ERC20) operations
- **Transactions**: Transaction management
- **Wallet**: Wallet operations and management
- **Common**: Shared utilities and types
- **Greenfield**: Support file management operations on Greenfield network including, uploading, downloading, and managing files and buckets
- Additional features coming soon (Greenfield, Swap, Bridge, etc.)

## Integration with Cursor

To connect to the MCP server from Cursor:

1. Open Cursor and go to Settings (gear icon in the top right)
2. Click on "MCP" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Add new global MCP server"
4. Enter the following details:

Default mode

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bnbchain-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@bnb-chain/mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "your_private_key_here. (optional)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

SSE mode

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bnbchain-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@bnb-chain/mcp@latest", "--sse"],
      "env": {
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "your_private_key_here. (optional)"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Integration with Claude Desktop

To connect to the MCP server from Claude Desktop:

1. Open Claude Desktop and go to Settings
2. Click on "Developer" in the left sidebar
3. Click the "Edit Config" Button
4. Add the following configuration to the `claude_desktop_config.json` file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bnbchain-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@bnb-chain/mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "your_private_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

5. Save the file and restart Claude Desktop

Once connected, you can use all the MCP prompts and tools directly in your Claude Desktop conversations. For example:

- "Analyze this address: 0x123..."
- "Explain the EVM concept of gas"
- "Check the latest block on BSC"

## Integration with Other Clients

If you want to integrate BNBChain MCP into your own client, please check out the [examples](./examples) directory for more detailed information and reference implementations.

The examples demonstrate:

- How to set up the MCP client
- Authentication and configuration
- Making API calls to interact with blockchain networks
- Handling responses and errors
- Best practices for integration

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [bun](http://bun.sh/) v1.2.10 or higher
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v17 or higher

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bnb-chain/bnbchain-mcp.git
cd bnbchain-mcp
```

2. Set up configuration:

You can configure the server using either environment variables or configuration files.

**Option 1: Environment Variables**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file with your configuration:
- `PRIVATE_KEY`: **REQUIRED** Your wallet private key (⚠️ MUST be set via environment variable only, never in config files)
- `DEFAULT_CHAIN_ID`: Default blockchain network (56=BSC, 97=BSC Testnet, 204=opBNB, 5611=opBNB Testnet)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- `PORT`: Server port number (default: 3001)
- `WRAPX_DEPLOYER_ADDRESS`: WrapX deployer contract address

**⚠️ SECURITY WARNING**: Never store private keys in configuration files or commit them to version control!

**Option 2: Configuration File**
```bash
cp config.example.json config.json
```

Edit `config.json` with your settings. Configuration files take precedence over defaults but environment variables override both.

For detailed configuration options, see [Configuration Guide](./docs/CONFIGURATION.md).
3. Install dependencies and start development server:

```bash
# Install project dependencies
bun install

# Start the development server
bun dev:sse
```

### Testing with MCP Clients

Configure the local server in your MCP clients using this template:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bnbchain-mcp": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3001/sse",
      "env": {
        "PRIVATE_KEY": "your_private_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing with Web UI

We use [`@modelcontextprotocol/inspector`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector) for testing. Launch the test UI:

```bash
bun run test
```

### Available Scripts

- `bun dev:sse`: Start development server with hot reload
- `bun build`: Build the project
- `bun test`: Run test suite
